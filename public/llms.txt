# SunScore - Solar Savings Calculator

> SunScore is a free solar savings calculator that uses official NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) government data to provide accurate solar energy estimates for homeowners across the United States.

## What SunScore Does

SunScore helps homeowners understand their solar potential by calculating:
- Estimated 25-year savings from switching to solar
- System cost estimates based on state-specific pricing
- Payback period (typically 6-10 years)
- Annual energy production in kWh
- Environmental impact (CO2 offset, trees equivalent)
- A "SunScore" rating (0-100) based on local solar irradiance

## How It Works

1. User enters their address (any US location)
2. System fetches solar irradiance data from NREL's PVWatts API
3. Calculator uses local electricity rates and solar installation costs
4. Results show side-by-side comparison: utility costs vs. solar ownership

## Data Sources

- **Solar Data**: NREL PVWatts v8 API (official US government data)
- **Electricity Rates**: State-by-state average rates from EIA data
- **Solar Pricing**: Regional $/watt installation costs (2024-2026 data)
